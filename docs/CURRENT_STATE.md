# Current state - 2026-11-06

## Objective and phase

Grandline Auto's visual and account patterns are being shared across three independent frontends. This repository now consumes the same versioned @grandline/ui archive as the other site. Hosted business and transport capabilities still need activation and real-account checks.

## Completed locally

Catalogue cards and two-column mobile/three-column desktop grids match Auto proportions. The listing wizard uses shared step navigation in a sidebar layout, with product-specific fields retained. Authenticated headers show the same Clerk avatar styling and link to the owner dashboard/notifications. The shared first-visit welcome dialog has Services copy. Saved application IDs are no longer exposed as a manual input. When live submission is disabled, visitors see a concise upfront maintenance state instead of a dead-end form; live copy explains immediate publication and seven-day payment verification. Source navigation defaults to the verified live Mobility Grandline domain.

## Verification and next action

The earlier frontend suite passed 63 tests. Final typecheck/build after the latest shared package update are in progress. Backend capabilities last showed all Services/Mobility/ride flags off; a later health probe timed out. No hosted environment settings were changed, so live submission is not yet claimed. Check hosting flags, Clerk instance/origins, media, billing accounts and deployment versions before customer-facing activation. Keep production data genuine and provider settings private.

Branch: main; unpushed local implementation checkpoint.
