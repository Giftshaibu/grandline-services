# Current state ? 2026-11-02

## Objective and phase

Immediate publication with parallel staff review and seven-day initial payment grace is implemented locally. Production rollout and database cleanup remain outstanding because no database/storage credentials are configured in this workspace. The user requested this release be committed and pushed; deployment success is not verified.

## Completed

Provider/shop cards and details show Pending review from the live API. Owner billing shows the initial verification deadline. Production sample catalogues and sample detail fallback are suppressed; development previews remain available.

Backend ownership remains in sibling grandline-backend. Public API additions are optional reviewStatus and private graceEndsAt/expiry information. Existing routes, manual receipt verification, fee schedules, capability flags, design tokens and generated route ownership are preserved. Existing genuine pending submissions are handled by the backend retry/backfill cycle after deployment; rejected records and incomplete drafts stay private.

## Verification

Typechecks, lint and production build were checked. Services has 60 passing tests; Mobility has 63. Backend has 160 passing unit tests, including concurrent upload serialization. Auto Hub lint has zero errors and six existing React refresh warnings. Database integration and authenticated owner/staff browser checks require live configuration and were not run.

## Working set and next action

UI cards/details, submission confirmations, billing panels and staff approval labels own this change. See sibling grandline-backend/IMMEDIATE_PUBLICATION_ROLLOUT.md for exact deployment order, cleanup commands, migration, production prerequisites and limits. Deploy the migration/backend before the frontends. Do not reseed production. Preserve all other completed ecosystem, inventory and ride integrations.

Branch: main. The release commit and push are recorded in Git. Git retains prior handoffs.
