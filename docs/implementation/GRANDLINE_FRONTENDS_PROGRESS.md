# Frontend progress

Updated 2026-10-28. Acceptance follows the approved frontend-first plan. Frontend complete does not mean live data or enquiries are enabled. Every absent backend operation remains blocked; see docs/api/PROPOSED_CONTRACTS.md.

## Rollback and release boundaries

Each chunk rolls back through a normal Git revert or previous Vercel deployment. No migrations or cross-repository source imports belong to either new frontend. Preserve the proposed-contract gate when reverting UI. Unit fixtures stay in tests; no production providers or simulated successful enquiries are supplied. CI configuration is committed but remote CI has not run because nothing was pushed.

The local Playwright runs exercised built Nitro previews: all 10 desktop/mobile tests passed per app. Windows preview processes needed explicit shutdown after browser workers finished; for repeat local runs, start `npm run preview` separately and let Playwright reuse it, then stop it yourself. Linux CI manages its own preview.

Auto Hub typecheck/build passed; lint has six existing fast-refresh warnings and no errors. Real catalogue/seller/staff/auth smoke tests require working backend and Clerk configuration. Cross-domain identity and production publication remain unverified.

## Production demo cleanup

Backend tooling is complete in commits 5caa4cb, 9e89770, 816290e and 07dfb45. Full backend unit/API suite: 119 passed; typecheck/build passed. Exact six seed IDs only, identity/dependency blockers, default dry-run, digest recheck, serializable apply and backup are implemented. The disposable PostgreSQL rollback/restore integration scenario and CI are prepared but were not executed locally because the Docker daemon is unavailable.

Production inventory, backup and deletion remain blocked by missing server-side credentials. No production connection or data change occurred. Follow ../grandline-backend/DEMO_CATALOGUE_CLEANUP.md, run the disposable database rehearsal, produce the exact affected-record preview/backup and obtain approval before deletion. Preserve reservations and linked submissions. No automatic push or deployment.

## Marketplace design and connected shops — 2026-10-28

Objective: match Auto Hub marketplace composition and introduce connected shop/heavy-duty/bike journeys. Dependencies: existing independent foundations; no backend implementation. Acceptance: responsive search/header/footer, real category links, image-led heroes, disabled unsupported journeys, no fabricated listings or inspection promises. Shared shop identity is proposed; spare-part links use only configured Hub /parts.

Checks: typecheck/lint/build, domain/component tests, desktop/mobile browser search, menus, filters and unavailable states. Final results are recorded in CURRENT_STATE.md. Rollback: revert the focused marketplace commits or redeploy the prior artifact. Commits: see Git history for feat(marketplace), test(marketplace) and docs(marketplace). Production activation remains blocked by backend operations and approved configuration.

Marketplace acceptance complete: source d668dcc/6b870d9, photos fe784f7, tests 8eebf37. Typecheck/lint/build passed; 28 unit/component and 16 desktop/mobile browser tests passed. Preview port 4301 avoids the Windows reserved range. Backend integration and production identity remain blocked.
