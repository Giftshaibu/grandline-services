# Proposed contracts — NOT implemented

Status: Blocked. These interfaces are a frontend proposal, not existing server routes. The UI uses a disabled adapter and sends no directory requests. Backend approval and implementation are required before enabling it. The source schema is src/lib/contracts.ts; no backend implementation is included.

| Proposed operation | Request | Response | Auth |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET /api/v1/service-providers/categories | none | array of slug/name | Public |
| GET /api/v1/service-providers | q, location, category, cursor, limit (default 20, max 50) | items and opaque nextCursor/null | Public |
| GET /api/v1/service-providers/:slug | slug | Entry or 404 | Public |
| POST /api/v1/service-providers/enquiries | listingId UUID, name (1–120), email (valid, max 254), message (10–2000) | id UUID, status=submitted | Bearer Clerk session token |

Search strings are trimmed and limited (q/location 120, category 80). Empty criteria are omitted; URLs round-trip criteria. Proposed results sort stably by backend relevance then ID; cursor ownership and validation remain backend concerns. No client-side filtering of partial result pages. No ratings or verification claims in this proposal. Images and external links allow HTTP(S) only.

Provider entries include identity, name, description, location, service area, categories, images, optional vehicle makes/hours, and optional phone/WhatsApp.

Failures: 400 invalid criteria, 401 sign-in required, 403 unauthorized, 404 detail absent, 409 duplicate/conflicting enquiry, 429 throttling, 5xx unavailable. Map network errors and malformed data separately from successful empty lists. Abort stale requests. Never treat an error response as an empty directory or a successful enquiry.

Implementation blockers: category/search/detail/enquiry routes; persistence and indexes; provider publication/moderation; enquiry ownership, audit, rate limiting and deduplication; Clerk authorized parties and production CORS. No dates, routes, cargo or passenger requirements in enquiry v1; add only after a backend contract is approved.

Activation: implement and validate server routes, add real integration tests, then replace the explicitly disabled adapter in a dedicated reviewed commit. There is no environment switch that silently enables proposed endpoints.
